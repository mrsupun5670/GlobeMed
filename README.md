## 🏗️ Architecture

GlobeMed is built using a robust architecture that implements multiple software design patterns for maintainability, scalability, and code organization.

### 🎨 Design Patterns Implemented

#### 1. **Bridge Pattern** 🌉
- **Location**: `src/bridge/`
- **Purpose**: Separates patient record management from role-based permissions
- **Implementation**: `PatientRecordBridge`, `RolePermission` classes
- **Benefit**: Allows independent variation of patient management and permission systems

```java
// Example: Role-based patient record access
PatientRecordBridge bridge = new SecurePatientRecordManager(new AdminPermission());
bridge.displayPatients(); // Only accessible with admin permissions
```

#### 2. **Composite Pattern** 🧩
- **Location**: `src/composite/`
- **Purpose**: Manages hierarchical permission structures
- **Implementation**: `PermissionComponent`, `Role`, `Permission` classes
- **Benefit**: Treats individual permissions and role groups uniformly

![Composite Pattern Diagram](assets/diagrams/composite-pattern.png)

#### 3. **Decorator Pattern** 🎭
- **Location**: `src/decorator/`
- **Purpose**: Adds functionality to data handling (encryption, compression, validation)
- **Implementation**: `DataHandler`, `EncryptedDataHandler`, `CompressedDataHandler`
- **Benefit**: Dynamically adds responsibilities without modifying core classes

#### 4. **Chain of Responsibility** ⛓️
- **Location**: `src/auth/`
- **Purpose**: Handles authentication and validation processes
- **Implementation**: `AuthHandler`, `PasswordValidationHandler`, `UserExistenceHandler`
- **Benefit**: Decouples request senders from receivers

#### 5. **Mediator Pattern** 🤝
- **Location**: `src/mediator/`
- **Purpose**: Manages appointment scheduling and coordination
- **Implementation**: `AppointmentMediator`, `AppointmentMediatorImpl`
- **Benefit**: Reduces dependencies between appointment-related classes

#### 6. **Visitor Pattern** 👥
- **Location**: `src/visitor/`
- **Purpose**: Generates different types of medical reports
- **Implementation**: `MedicalDataVisitor`, `DiagnosticReportVisitor`, `FinancialReportVisitor`
- **Benefit**: Adds new operations without modifying existing data structures

### 📊 System Architecture Diagram

![System Architecture](assets/diagrams/system-architecture.png)

### 🗃️ Database Integration

The system uses an in-memory data management approach with the following components:

- **Data Storage**: `src/util/DBData.java` - Centralized data management
- **Data Models**: `src/model/` - Entity classes (Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Bill)
- **Data Access**: Repository pattern implementation for CRUD operations
